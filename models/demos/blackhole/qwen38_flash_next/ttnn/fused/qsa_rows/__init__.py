"""``qsa_rows``: the QSA verify-form glue on the 32-row tile at R real rows, as fused programs.

``Qwen38TTNNQSA.forward_verify_generic`` runs the R rows P .. P + R - 1 of one pass on one 32-row tile (R = k + 1 the
MTP verify rows of the twelve backbone layers, R = 1 the MTP layer's draft row padded in place); its glue around the
kept kernels (the all-gather of the hidden rows, the six linears, the indexer, the top-k, sparse_sdpa, the out linear
and its reduce-scatter) is ~62 small programs per layer.  This family replaces them program by program, each bitwise
against the chain it stands for on the rows the tile carries (rows past R are not zero on the verify tile: every
program masks or ignores them exactly as its chain does).  Opt-in as one name, ``QWEN38_FUSED=qsa_rows``.

Program 1, ``score_blocks_rows``: the indexer scores' all-reduce and mask add.  The chain is ``ttnn.all_reduce`` (its
composite: the all-broadcast, a concat, tilize, ``moreh_sum`` over the device dim, untilize) and ``ttnn.add`` of the
per-row block mask, six programs and ~130 us per layer at 32 rows.  Here, as the decode chain's ``qsa_score_merge``
does for one row: the local rows as 2 KB pages, one ``all_gather`` (device d's page c of row r lands at page
``(d * rows + r) * chunks + c``), then ``qsa_block.score_merge`` (the composite's moreh_sum order, then the mask add)
over all 32 rows of the tile at once -- that program's device test holds it bitwise against the chain per row at 1, 2,
5 and 32 rows; the mask is the chunk's ``[1, 1, 32, blocks]`` row mask, so the rows past R are masked as the chain
masks them.
